# Visual_Fourier_transform
Visualization of how any complex function can be transformed into sum of harmonic functions

# Warning:
You can not use "Load from file" case if yo do not have a program which transforms your .svg file to vector function. I did not push it to this repo because it is not my program. Use "Examples" case instead, there are several images in the directory "functions".
